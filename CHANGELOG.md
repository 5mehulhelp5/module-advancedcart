## [1.0.17] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed
- Checkout order note: the "Saving..." status under the note field is no longer always visible. It appears only while the note is being saved, then shows "Saved" for two seconds (or "Could not save note" when saving fails) and clears. The status is announced politely to screen readers.
